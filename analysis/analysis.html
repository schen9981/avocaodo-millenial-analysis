        </div>

        <h2> Project Overview and Hypothesis </h2>

          <p> This projects seeks to explore the trends in avocado consumption in
              the US, in connection with millenials, a group classified as those
              born between 1980 and 1994. </p>

          <p> We expect that cities in the United States with a higher population
              of millenials, especially those with a high population of millenials
              with above-average income, consume more avocados despite prices
              increases in recent years. </p>

        <h2> Methodology </h2>

          <p> Our analysis consisted of 3 main components: <p>

          <ol>
            <li> Reorganization and Joining Data
                 <p>  After finding and cleaning our raw data and reading them
                      and reading them into database files, we reorganized and
                      did further cleaning in order to best support our
                      analysis methods </p>
            </li>
            <li> Statistical Tests
                 <p> This entailed computing relevant metrics, statistical tests
                     to determine the strength of the relationship of our variables,
                     and regressions. </p>
            </li>
            <li> Visualizations
                  <p> We plotted the raw data, as well as different metrics
                      that would help us gauge general trends over the years.
                      We also visualized the outputs of our regression models. </p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h4> Reorganization and Joining Data </h4>

          <p> Our analysis was dependent on common regions (California, Plains,
          South Central, Midsouth, Southeast, Great Lakes, Northeast) defined by
          the Hass Avocado Board for both the avocado consumption data and the demographic data. </p>

          <p> Our raw data composed of the avocado consumption for 2016, 2017, and 2018
          for cities/states specified in the raw data, as well as the accumulated
          consumption data for Hass Avocado Board defined regions. Thus, we
          extracted out the accumulated consumption for the regions specified above, into a new table. </p>

          <p> As for our raw data for demographic, this had data regarding gender, age, and population for
          each state for each of the years 2016, 2017, and 2018. We first removed the
          data for Alaska and Hawaii, as these states were not taken into account for the
          avocado consumption regions. We created a new column called 'region',
          where we labeled each state with its appropriate region. Then, for each state in region X, we
          added up population for each age (while keeping gender separated). </p>

          <p> This way, we have a 'region' parameter across our demographic and avocado
          consumption data that we can use to join the tables to perform analysis. </p>

          <h4> Statistical Tests </h4>

          <p> [TODO] Why did you use this statistical test or ML algorithm? Which other tests
          did you consider or evaluate? How did you measure success or failure?
          Why that metric/value? What challenges did you face evaluating the model?
          Did you have to clean or restructure your data? </p>

          <p> A summary of our linear regression run on each year is below: (2016, 2017, 2018) </p>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="column">
              <img src="2016_reg_summary.png" width=100%>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
              <img src="2017_reg_summary.png" width=100%>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
              <img src="2018_reg_summary.png" width=100%>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p> Based on the simple linear regression and the R-squared values,
            we can see that the variability in millennial population percentage
            explains a good portion of the variability in the per capita avocados
            sold data around its mean. </p>

          <p> [TODO] If you did a statistics test, are there any confounding trends or
          variables you might be observing? </p>

          <h4> Visualization </h4>

          We picked a bar graph in order to display the initial avocado purchasing trends of the 8 regions
          to see if our hypothesis was substantial.

          <br><img src="avocado_by_region.png" width=80%></img>

          <p> Here, we can see that there appears to be an increasing trend in the amount of avocados
          sold each year in each region from 2016-2018. </p>

          <p> Our second figure (below) shows a side-by-side bar graph which also helped
            us to determine if our hypothesis was sensible.  This figure
            displays the average avocado sales from 2016-2018, and the average
            percentage of the region which were millennials from 2016-2018.
            Here, we can see that it appears that the regions who have slightly
            greater percentage millennials in their populations purchased more
            avocados. </p>

          <br><img src="avocado_percentage_region.png" width=60%></img>

          <p> In the last two figures (below), we have scatter plots which have the population percentage
          of each region/year grouping (Boomer percentage for the first, Millenial
          percentage for the second), and the avocado sales for that corresponding region/year.
          Here, we can see that in the second figure, there does appear to be a positive
          correlation, while the first figure appears to have even a negative correlation.
          We could communicate our visualization differently, perhaps by dividing our
          data by city/state or some smaller matric in order to see various trends, however
          by region seems to be the most concise and easiest to view. </p>

          <br><img src="avocado_consumption_capita_proportion.png" width=80%></img>

          <br><img src="avocado_proportion_millenial.png" width=60%></img>

          <p> Some challenges we faced when visualizing the results were making sure that
          both region, year, avocado sales, and population millenial were all
          incorporated into our visualization so that our goals are easy to understand.
          Our visualizations may require some context such as what areas of the
          countries different regions represent as defined by the Hass Avocado Board.
          However, it should be relatively self-explanatory what trends appears
          in our visualizations. </p>
