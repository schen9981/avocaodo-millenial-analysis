        </div>

        <h2> Project Overview and Hypothesis </h2>

          <p> This projects seeks to explore the trends in avocado consumption in
              the US, in connection with millenials, a group classified as those
              born between 1980 and 1994.</p>

          <p> Hypothesis: We expect that cities in the United States with a higher proportion
              of millenials consume more avocados despite prices increases in recent years. </p>

        <h2> Methodology </h2>

          <p> Our analysis consisted of 3 main components: <p>

          <ol>
            <li> Reorganization and Joining Data
                 <p>  After finding and cleaning our raw data and reading them into database files, we reorganized, joined, and
                      did further cleaning in order to best support our
                      analysis methods </p>
            </li>
            <li> Statistical Tests
                 <p> This entailed computing relevant metrics, statistical tests
                     to determine the strength of the relationship of our variables,
                     and regressions. For this checkpoint, we ran some simple OLS regressions.</p>
            </li>
            <li> Visualizations
                  <p> We plotted the raw data, as well as different metrics
                      that would help us gauge general trends over the years.
                      We also visualized the outputs of our regression models. </p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h4> Reorganization and Joining Data </h4>

          <p> Our analysis was dependent on common regions (California, Plains,
          South Central, Midsouth, Southeast, Great Lakes, Northeast) defined by
          the Hass Avocado Board for both the avocado consumption data and the demographic data. </p>

          <p> Our raw data composed of the avocado consumption for 2016, 2017, and 2018
          for cities/states specified in the raw data, as well as the accumulated
          consumption data for Hass Avocado Board defined regions. Thus, we
          extracted out the accumulated consumption for the regions specified above, into a new table. </p>

          <p> As for our raw data for demographic, this had data regarding gender, age, and population for
          each state for each of the years 2016, 2017, and 2018. We first removed the
          data for Alaska and Hawaii, as these states were not taken into account for the
          avocado consumption regions. We created a new column called 'region',
          where we labeled each state with its appropriate region. Then, for each state in region X, we
          added up population for each age (while keeping gender separated). </p>

          <p> This way, we have a 'region' parameter across our demographic and avocado
          consumption data that we then used to join the tables and perform analysis. </p>

          <p> We also used population data to compute and store the per capita avocado sales for each region.
              Running tests on per capita data makes more sense then running tests on lump-sum data because each region has a
              different number of consumers, which is a confounding variable when analyzing the relationship between
              the <i>proportion</i> of millenials and number of avocados sold.
          </p>

          <h4> Statistical Tests </h4>

          <p> We used a simple linear regression because it served as a way to
            see the extent of effect our independent variable (millennial population
            percentage) had on our dependent variable (avocados sold per capita), and in what
            way our input variable impacted the output variable. We considered running a
            two-sample t-Test, but we had trouble determining which 2 samples, given our
            current data sets, we would run it on in order to test our hypothesis. Success
            would be measured by observing the R-squared value and the regression coefficient,
            as a relatively high R-squared value provides an estimate of the strength of the
            relationship between our model and the dependent variable and a  positive regression
            coefficient would indicate that as the value of the independent variable increases,
            the mean of the dependent variable also tends to increase. <p>

          <p> One challenge we faced while evaluating the model was since our initial data
            points consisted of 8 regions, it would be hard to control appropriately.
            Therefore, we may need to restructure our data by trying to get city-level
            data and then expand our analysis accordingly. <p>

          <p> A summary of our linear regression run on each year is below: (2016, 2017, 2018) </p>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="column">
              <img src="2016_reg_summary.png" width=100%>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
              <img src="2017_reg_summary.png" width=100%>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
              <img src="2018_reg_summary.png" width=100%>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p> Based on the simple linear regression and the R-squared values,
            we can see that the variability in millennial population percentage
            explains a good portion of the variability in the per capita avocados
            sold data around its mean. Additionally, a positive regression
            coeffeicient indicates that as our independent variable increases,
            the mean of the dependent variable also tends to increase.
        </p>

          <p> One challenge of our project is controlling for confounding variables.
            Consumer preferences are influenced by a ton of different factors, and age is
            only one of them. It's also tough to control for variables when our regions
            cover such large areas.</p>

          <p>
            We're hoping to analyze these factors more thoroughly in the
            coming weeks, ideally by finding more fine-grained region data. For now,
            our tests are more suitable for testing correlation than causation. Perhaps
            avocado sales are closely tied with disposable income levels and millenials
            happen to have the highest level of disposable income. Or, pehaps avocado sales
            are closely linked with the prevalence of "health-campaigns" advertising the
            fruit as a super-food and millenials happen to be most-targetted. Either way,
            we think our tests offers some support to our hypothesis, although we can't
            necessarily claim a causal relationship.
          </p>

          <h4> Visualization </h4>

          <p>We first made a 3D bar graph to visualize the relationship between avocado sales,
            region, and year. This is an exploratory plot and gave us a general sense of our
            avocado data looked like.
          </p>

          <br><img src="sales_region_year_3d.png" width=60%></img>

          <p> Here, we can see that there appears to be an increasing trend in the average per capital amount of avocados
          sold each year from 2016-2018. This trend is consistent across all regions.</p>

          <p> Our second figure (below) shows a side-by-side bar graph which also helped
            us to determine if our hypothesis was sensible.  This figure
            displays the average avocado sales from 2016-2018, and the average
            percentage of the region which were millennials from 2016-2018.
            Here, we can see that it appears that the regions who have slightly
            greater percentage millennials in their populations purchased more
            avocados, which supports our hypothesis. </p>

          <br><img src="avocado_percentage_region.png" width=60%></img>

          <p> In the last two figures (below), we have scatter plots which have the population percentage
          of each region/year grouping (Boomer percentage for the first, Millenial
          percentage for the second), and the avocado sales for that corresponding region/year.
          Here, we can see that in the second figure, there does appear to be a positive
          correlation, while the first figure appears to have even a negative correlation.
          We could communicate our visualization differently, perhaps by dividing our
          data by city/state or some smaller matric in order to see various trends, however
          by region seems to be the most concise and easiest to view. </p>

          <br><img src="avocado_consumption_capita_proportion.png" width=80%></img>

          <br><img src="avocado_proportion_millenial.png" width=60%></img>

          <p> Some challenges we faced when visualizing the results were making sure that
          both region, year, avocado sales, and population millenial were all
          incorporated into our visualization so that our goals are easy to understand.
          Our visualizations may require some context such as what areas of the
          countries different regions represent as defined by the Hass Avocado Board.
          However, it should be relatively self-explanatory what trends appears
          in our visualizations. </p>
