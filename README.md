# CSCI 1951a Data Science Final Project: Avocados and Millenials

This projects seeks to explore the trends in avocado consumption in the US,
in connection with millenials, a group classified as those born between
1980 and 1994.

## Hypothesis

We expect that cities in the United States with a higher population of millenials,
especially those with a high population of millenials with above-average
income, consume more avocados despite prices increases in recent years.
